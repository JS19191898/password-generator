# password-generator

Using a mix of provided code, as well as original code, I worked to provide a running password generator. As of this README commit, I have a singular syntax error on my js file that is seemingly preventing my code from running well. Specifically, there is a console error present whenever the generate password button is clicked. Apart from this, the architecture is present and everything apart from the syntax seems to be working. I do not know how to get around this error as of yet. Hopefully this is one of those "right under my nose" fixes. I do not mind starting over from scratch later on if need be though.
